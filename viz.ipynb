I didn't even clearly remember it until #MeToo started trending and I read someone's story that sounded similar to mine, and it brought everything rushing back. I don't know if there was anything before this, but I do know that this probably effected me profoundly. I spent years being emotionally unavailable, viewing sex as meaningless and detached from intimacy, and resignedly accepting it when boys or men would corner or grope me.

I shifted so he would stop and he eventually left, but came back a few times, luckily my dog was there and blocked him from doing anything too bad.

      "I was 5 when my aunt’s husband was “wrestling” with me in his bed. Thankfully my aunt came home early from grocery shopping and though she never said anything about what happened to anyone, she made a point to never leave me alone with her husband and wouldn’t let my parents leave me under his care while they worked. I always felt uneasy about the type of wrestling he was showing me and that it was in the bed, but as I grew up I realized what his true intentions were. I was embarrassed over it and didn’t tell anyone until a teacher in middle school had a lecture about sex-ed and what wasn’t okay. After the class I told him what happened and the school reported it to the police. I spoke with two police officers who asked me a lot of questions and they mentioned they’d be talking to my parents that same day. Up until two months ago I believed the police had spoken with my parents about this and that it was something we simply never talked about. Then my mom mentioned having seen that man recently and I questioned her why she was telling me about him and if she doesn’t recall what the police had told her when I was in middle school. She informed me that no one ever called her or my dad about anything having to do with the police. Realizing she was telling the truth I stopped myself from telling her what happened. I’m trying to gain the courage to sit down and tell her everything, but for whatever reason I’m nervous about doing so. I’m a mom now and have a lot of anxiety when it comes to anyone that isn’t my husband or our mom’s taking care of our children. I’ve recently been thinking about going to therapy. I’m hoping that will help.  \n",
